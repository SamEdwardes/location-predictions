## Background

Have you ever wondered if you can predict someones location by the weather? Finally, there is a tool to do so. The weather based location prediction app works by using the following monthly average parameters to predict your location:

- precipitation
- snow
- snow depth
- min temperature 
- max temperature
- month of the year

## The Model

```{r load_data, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(data.table)
station <- fread("cdn_stations.csv")
weather <- fread("monthly_weather.csv")
```

A random forest classifcation model was built using data from the [NOAA Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily table (GHCN-Daily)](https://data.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00861). The data was filtered to only include Canadian weather stations. Data from `r length(unique(weather$station.id))` stations was used to create the prediction model.

```{r weather_summary1}
summary(weather)
```

## Weather Stations

The interactive leaflet map shows the location of each station.

```{r map, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
selected_stations <- unique(weather$station.id)
map <- subset(station, station.id %in% selected_stations) %>% leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers()
map
```

## Use the model
